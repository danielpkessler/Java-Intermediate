Employee Data Analysis PROGRAM

Java program that provides a comprehensive solution for managing and analyzing employee information. The program demonstrates various functions to manipulate and interpret employee data stored in arrays. These functions include counting the number of employees based on their job roles (programmers, analysts, operators), determining the number of operators consuming 3 or more cups of coffee, finding the average coffee consumption of programmers, and identifying the maximum and minimum coffee consumption among analysts and operators, respectively. The program offers a practical tool for efficient data analysis and management of employee records in a Java environment.


Palindrome Checker and Text Transformation PROGRAM

Java program that offers a versatile tool for analyzing phrases. The program processes a set of input phrases, removes punctuation and spaces, and converts the text to uppercase. It then checks if the modified phrase is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and displays the results. The palindrome verification function, estPalindrome, compares the original phrase with its reverse, while the affichertout function handles the text transformation and display. The program helps determine if a phrase is a palindrome.


Person Information Analysis and Sorting PROGRAM

Java program that processes and analyzes personal information for a group of individuals. The program defines a Personne class with attributes for birthdate and coffee consumption. It provides two constructors for different levels of information input, and various methods to access and modify the data.


Country Data Management and Analysis PROGRAM

Java program that reads country information from a file, processes it, and provides functionalities such as displaying, modifying, sorting, searching for specific countries, and creating text files based on continent codes. It efficiently manages country data, making use of Java arrays, file I/O, sorting algorithms, and binary search techniques.


Employee Data Management and Analysis PROGRAM

Java program that offers comprehensive functionality for processing and analyzing employee information. It introduces the Employe class with attributes like social insurance numbers, weekly salaries, and hourly rates, enabling the creation and manipulation of employee data. In TestEmploye, it showcases the program's capabilities by displaying detailed information about specific employees, modifying salaries based on calculations, and generating information for a new set of employees. Additionally, the program counts and displays statistics related to employee salaries and NAS numbers, effectively sorting and exporting the data to a text file. It effectively exemplifies Java's object-oriented features for the organized management and analysis of employee data.
